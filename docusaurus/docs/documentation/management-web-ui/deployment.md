# Deployment

The deployment was made on a EC2 instance on AWS. A pipeline was created to deploy the system automatically, so that it is faster and easier to deploy the frontend.
The pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/eduardosantoshf/es-project/blob/development/.github/workflows/management-ui-deploy.yml)
