# User Story Readiness Criteria
## Definition of Ready

The user story is "ready" when:

* Cumplies with the criterion **INVEST**:
    * **Independent**: Stories should be as independent as possible.
    * **Negotiable**: A story is not a contract. A story is an invitation to a conversation. The story captures the essence of what is desired.  
    * **Valuable**: If a story does not have discernable value it should not be done.
    * **Estimable**: A story has to be able to be estimated or sized so it can be properly prioritized.
    * **Small**: Obviously stories are small chunks of work, but how small should they be? The answer depends on the team and the methodology being used. 
    * **Testable**: Every story needs to be testable in order to be “done.”  In fact, I like to think of testable meaning acceptance criteria can be written immediately.    
* Has Acceptance Criteria (in a specific format like Given-When-Then)
* Has the estimated Story Points
* Has prioritization ranked appropriately in the product backlog 

:::note

* Product owner faz/refaz user stories, colocando-os no product backlog, tendo em conta o objetivo do produto.
* Developers decidem que user stories de alta prioridade do product backlog esperam fazer numa dada sprint.
* Developers criam backlog do sprint decompondo os itens, e fazendo tasks, estimando o tempo das tasks

:::tip Tip

* Think of stories from the perspective of delivering value, not tasks.
* Refinement usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team.
