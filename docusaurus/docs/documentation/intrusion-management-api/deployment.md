# Deployment

The deployment was made on a EC2 instance on AWS. A pipeline was created to deploy the system automatically, so that it is faster and easier to deploy the API.
The pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/eduardosantoshf/es-project/blob/development/.github/workflows/intrusion-management-api-deploy.yml)
