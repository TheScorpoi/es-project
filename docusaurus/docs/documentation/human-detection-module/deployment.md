# Deployment 

In order to have scalability in the HDM module, the deployment was made on the Amazon Elastic Container Service. 

A [pipeline](https://github.com/eduardosantoshf/es-project/blob/development/.github/workflows/human-detection-deployment.yaml) was created in order to automatically build, test and deploy this module through GitHub Actions.
